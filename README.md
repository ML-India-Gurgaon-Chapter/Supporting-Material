# ML-meetup Materials
This file contains all the materials which are discussed during different meetups and other basic resources.

## Some resources for ML
A couple of good resources for brushing the basics in machine learning

- [Bayesian Methods for Hackers](http://camdavidsonpilon.github.io/Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers/#contents)
- [All of statistics (Wasserman) and Pattern Classification (Duda Hart)](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BwKTovFlBEEJX1NpLUFNQmd2bVk). For start, one can start with the first 3 chapters of Duda hart and some of the basic statistics chapter of Wasserman.

## 7th ML-Meetup - Mr. Janu Verma
[Janu Verma](http://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view.php?person=us-jverma) is a machine learning and data visualization researcher at IBM T.J. Watson Research Center in New York. He has held research positions at Cornell University, Kansas State University, Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Jawahar Lal Nehru Center for Advanced Scientific Research, and Indian Statistical Institute. The central concept of this talk was word2vec - distributed vector representations, which are computed using a convolutional neural network.
